<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<br>
<h3>Typopocalypse</h3>
<br>
<p>Typopocalypse is a typing game that challenges your typing skills and helps you become a better typist. The game measures
your typing speed and error rate to provide an accurate WPM value which is then tracked and can be viewed in a graph for
viewing your progress over time. The goal of Typopocalypse is: Don't let the monster catch you. To prevent the monster
from attacking you, you must overcome obstacles that appear by quickly typing action words. In addition, there are words
appearing constantly that must be typed or else your score will fall. If you fail to keep your typing speed up and error
rate down, the monster will get you and it will be game over.</p>
<br>
<p>The words that are chosen will be based on the difficulty level that you choose. On easy mode, you'll only have to type
3 or 4 letter words, but once you reach hard difficulty, you'll have to type 7+ letter words and each mistake will be
even more punishing and only the best typists will succeed. There will be a range of difficulty levels in-between, so
all typists can practice their typing skills and improve.</p>
<br>
<p>On a technical level, the words are stored in files based on difficulty level. The words are then loaded into the
program memory as a string array, a random number index is generated, and a word is sent to the screen to be typed. The
words will disappear upon being correctly typed. A character on screen will represent the player and the monster will be
on one side of the character chasing them. The character will move left and right to demonstrate how far away from the
monster they are. The character speeds up or slows down depending on the quality of the user's typing. Upon successful
escape(or not) from the monster, a graph will pop up showing their typing speed and other details and allow them to start a new
game.</p>
