    <h2>Story #1</h2>
      <p>
         As a someone who is not very good at typing I want a game that has a range of difficulties so someone from any skill level can play and enjoy the game. The game should also have good mechanics and be user friendly with an intuitive feel to it.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Elaboration:</strong> Incorporate different difficulty modes for the player
        <br><br>
        <strong>Constraints:</strong> none
        <br><br>
        <strong>Effort Estimation:</strong> 2 hours
        <br><br>
        <Strong>Acceptance Test:</Strong> You are able to choose what difficulty you want before the game starts. Easier difficulty has shorer words to type and harder difficulties have longer words to type.
    </p>

    <h2>Story #2</h2>
    <p>
        As someone who is very competitive I want to see my username and score on a leader board along with other users. This leaderboard should show the top ten best players and the duration of how long they have held that rank.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Elaboration:</strong> Implements a leaderboard that keeps track of the high score of other user and shows the top ten best players in the game
        <br><br>
        <strong>Constraints:</strong> none
        <br><br>
        <strong>Effort Estimation:</strong> 12 hours
        <br><br>
        <Strong>Acceptance Test:</Strong> The leaderboard shows the score, username and amount of time holding the rank for the top ten players and actively updates the list when scores are broken.
     </p>

     <h2>Story #3</h2>
     <p>
         I'm a kid who doesn't know how to type but would like to learn.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Elaboration:</strong> Implement a beginner mode that takes the monster out and gives hints on how to type effectively.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Constraints:</strong> This could require refactoring some of the game logic.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Effort Estimation:</strong> 20 hours
         <br><br>
         <Strong>Acceptance Test:</Strong> A child could sit down at the computer and learn how to type just using our game.
