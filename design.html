    For our code it is split into three main folders: entity, main, and map all located in src. Entity contains
    classes that control all player anmination, obstacles and word streaming. This includes classes that control
    the cowboy as well as dinosaur. And classes for all different modes (Campaign, Regular, infinite). 

    Main includes all of the higher level functions. Such as the main class which initiates the gameplay. Game Panel
    which creates the panel in which the game is on and calls all classes in order to update items on the screen. As well 
    as MouseInput and InputHandler which are in charge of recognizing mouse input and key input. 

    Map includes classes to load the map into the world for both regular and campqaign as well as infinite.
