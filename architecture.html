<h2>Architecture for Typopocalypse</h2>

<h3>Model View Controller</h3>
<br>
<p>The model view controller architecture is used to divide the program logic into three main interconnected components. 
These are the model, view and controller. Each one is built to handle specific parts of the program. 
The model handles all of the data the user interacts with. This would be the collision detection in our game for example.  
The view is all of the ui elements on the screen. So in our case that would be the map, player and the word, etc. 
The last one is the controller which handles all the user input like typing in the words.</p>
