<h2>Test Report</h2>
<br>
<h3>Component Testing</h3>
<p>For Typopocalypse we did not have any standard testing process. Each member tested there code and made sure it worked 
  before pushing it. Any bugs were handled as they came up. Most of our testing was done by playing the game and seeing
  what worked and what didn't.
</p>
<h3>System Testing</h3>
<p>Since we used Java for developing the game, we had a relatively smooth time gettin the game running on any system.
  Our members developed with a mix of Windows and Mac computer so we would immedietely be able to tell if one system was 
  misbehaving and adjust accordingly. One such occurunce was when we tried to implement a shell script to manage restarting
  the game. The shell script worked great on mac but had issues when ran from a windows machine. Luckily this allowed us to
  find a better solution that didn't require any additional tools for handling restarting the game.
</p>
<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p>Each developer did their own acceptance testing as the project progressed. We also had family members/friends
  try out the game and that provided us with invaluable feedback. Our user-stories were templates so we don't have
  any direct testing in regards to those, but the people that tried the game reacted positively.
