            <h2>1.1 Purpose of Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Test users typing speed while challenging them to a fun interactive game. Encourage user to type as fast as possible to avoid being eaten by the monster chasing them. 
                    User will progress through various levels and be confronted by different challenges that get increasingly more difficult. Users skill and progress will be tracked through
                    a high score table that shows their fastest typing speed. 
                </p>
                
            <h2>1.2 Scope of Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Game will include a minimum of three levels of increasing difficulty that will increase both speed user is required to type as well as length of the words themselves. In higher 
                    difficulty levels user will be required to type specific action words that enable the character to jump over or crouch under obstacles. When character runs into monster chasing them 
                    the game will end. Lastly if user types correct words then the speed of the character will increase and incorrect words will make it slow down. 

                    Game will have a start menu that also has a high score that maintains the users fastest typing speed.

                    playerX/playerY: Controls character movement (Jumping, crouching, speeding up, and slowing down). 
                    worldX/worldY: Controls world movement (Makes it appear that character is running through world).
                    monsterX/monsterY:  Sets monsters position (Monster does not move, only animation of monster changes).

        <h1>2. General Description of Product</h1>
            <p>
                Typopocalypse is a typing game that challenges your typing skills and helps you become a better typist. The game measures
                your typing speed and error rate to provide an accurate WPM value which is then tracked and can be viewed in a graph for
                viewing your progress over time.
            </p>

            <h2>2.1 Context of Product</h2>
                <p>The game will be played on a desktop or laptop.</p>

            <h2>2.2 Domain Model with Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The game is implemented using Object-oriented programming in Java. Different domain objects include: words files, 
                    pixel art for graphics, and classes for each system including: InputHandler, Monster, Player, GamePanel, Entity,
                    and a main driver program.
                </p>

            <h2>2.3 Product Functions (general)</h2>
                <p>
                    The words that are chosen will be based on the difficulty level that you choose. On easy mode, you'll only have to type
                    3 or 4 letter words, but once you reach hard difficulty, you'll have to type 7+ letter words and each mistake will be
                    even more punishing and only the best typists will succeed. There will be a range of difficulty levels in-between, so
                    all typists can practice their typing skills and improve.
                </p>

            <h2>2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations</h2>
                <p>Typists of all ability should be able to benefit from the game.</p>

            <h2>2.5 Constraints</h2>
                <p>None at this time.</p>

            <h2>2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
                <p>Java must be installed on host machine. Some comfort with computers and typing is probably necessary to begin.</p>
