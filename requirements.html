            <h2>1.1 Purpose of Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Test users typing speed while challenging them to a fun interactive game. Encourage user to type as fast as possible to avoid being eaten by the monster chasing them. 
                    User will progress through various levels and be confronted by different challenges that get increasingly more difficult. Users skill and progress will be tracked through
                    a high score table that shows their fastest typing speed.

            <h2>1.2 Scope of Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Game will include a minimum of three levels of increasing difficulty that will increase both speed user is required to type as well as length of the words themselves. In higher 
                    difficulty levels user will be required to type specific action words that enable the character to jump over or crouch under obstacles. When character runs into monster chasing them 
                    the game will end. Lastly if user types correct words then the speed of the character will increase and incorrect words will make it slow down. 

                    Game will have a start menu that also has a high score that maintains the users fastest typing speed.
