# Ctrl-Alt-Defeat

## Demo 1 Release 
In Demo 1 we have the building blocks for which our whole game will be based on. Our character has the ability to 
move independently of the world which allows him to speed up, slow down and jump (based on user input). Our world 
also moves in the background to simulate the character running through it. Next, we have a "monster" that is chasing 
our character. This monster only has animation for now but with the use of collision detection will be able to  end 
the game if its run into.

Our text stream also is able to pull words randomly from a text file without repeats. These words are displayed above 
the character and also can move independently of the world so we can control the speed of them independently. This 
will allow us to increase the difficulty by speeding up the words. Lastly, these words can change color with user input. 
This will allow us to eventually make a letter turn green when correctly typed and red when incorrectly typed.
